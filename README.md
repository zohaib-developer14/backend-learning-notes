# 🔐 Security Concepts (Backend Notes)

Backend development is not just about building APIs — real backend engineering requires a strong security mindset. This section covers the foundational security concepts that are essential for designing production-level systems.

## 📌 Covered Concepts

* Validation vs Duplicate Check
* Database Unique Constraints
* Race Condition
* Verification vs Authentication vs Authorization
* JWT Basics
* Layered Security Model
* Zero Trust Principle

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Section

The goal of this section is to understand that:

* Not every request can be trusted
* Every layer has a specific security responsibility
* Authentication alone does not make a system secure
* Data integrity and abuse prevention are equally important

These concepts form the foundation of secure and scalable backend architecture.

---

## 🧠 Core Security Philosophy

> Assume a breach is possible.
> Design systems so that a single failure does not compromise everything.

Layered security combined with a Zero Trust approach is the backbone of production-ready backend systems.
